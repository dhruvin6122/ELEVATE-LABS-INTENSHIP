# Task 6 - KNN Classification

This project implements the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm on the Iris dataset using Scikit-learn.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Steps:
1. Loaded and normalized the dataset.
2. Used `KNeighborsClassifier` to train the model.
3. Tried different values of K to find the optimal one.
4. Evaluated with accuracy score and confusion matrix.
5. Visualized decision boundaries (using 2D feature projection).

## Accuracy Achieved:
Varied with K, best observed at K=3 with >90% accuracy.

## Output:
- Accuracy chart for different K values.
- Confusion matrix.
- Decision boundary plots.
