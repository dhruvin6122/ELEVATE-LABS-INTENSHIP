# âœ… Task 4: Logistic Regression - Binary Classification

## ðŸ“Œ Dataset
- Used the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset** from Kaggle  
  Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## ðŸ§  What I Did
1. Selected a binary classification dataset
2. Split data into **train/test sets** and applied **standardization**
3. Trained a **Logistic Regression model**
4. Evaluated using:
   - **Confusion Matrix**
   - **Precision**, **Recall**, **F1 Score**
   - **ROC-AUC Curve**
5. Explained and visualized the **Sigmoid Function**
6. Tuned the **classification threshold**

## ðŸ“Š Accuracy Results
- Logistic Regression Accuracy: ~95%
- ROC-AUC Score: ~98%

## âœ… Conclusion
- Logistic Regression works well for binary classification.
- ROC-AUC curve and threshold tuning help improve model decision-making.
